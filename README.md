# Spacecraft Cabin Safety AI Simulation

This project simulates an onboard AI safety module that monitors cabin temperature and CO₂ levels, using predefined thresholds to raise alerts. The project integrates **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** diagrams with a functional **MATLAB simulation module**.

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB
- Visual Paradigm (for MBSE system modeling)
- GitHub (version control and collaboration)

## Project Structure
- `matlab_module/AI_Module.m`: Simulates sensor readings and evaluates environmental safety conditions.
- `diagrams/`: Includes system architecture, use case, and interface diagrams created with Visual Paradigm.
- `outputs/`: (Optional) Includes saved plots or logs of alerts.

## Features
- Simulates cabin environment sensor data (temp & CO₂)
- Applies AI logic to classify conditions as NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL
- Logs alerts and generates real-time plots
- System modeled with Visual Paradigm using MBSE practices

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to `matlab_module/`.
3. Run `AI_Module.m`.
